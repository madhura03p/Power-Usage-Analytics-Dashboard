# Power-Usage-Analytics-Dashboard
Developed during my internship at Tata Motors, this interactive dashboard monitors and analyzes electrical power usage using Dash and Plotly. It offers shift-wise analysis, trend/seasonality detection, and a 7-day SARIMA consumption forecast. Users can filter data by stations, shifts, and custom date ranges for detailed insights.
